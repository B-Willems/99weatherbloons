GOALS 99WeatherBloons
------------------------------------
1: HOGE TOREN

2: LoRa communication over >10km
3: collect data on high altitude balloon
	a: Temp
	b: Humidity
	c: Altitude
	d: GPS (Wind direction in post processing)
	e: (extention) Take a picture on high altitude.
4: Send data over LoRa To Raspberry pi ON A HIGH TOWER!!!!	
5: Make project open source.
6: Cheap and for everyone!!!


ROADBLOCKS
----------------------------------
Can't talk at same time as other ppl 				==> cashe & send
Getting tower permission					==> Watertower is goal, other high tower is possible. Prefferably with power
GPS can lose connection at a certain altitude			==> ????
Knalgas can't buy so have to make. 				==> electrolisis
Parachute?							==> ????
What microcontroller should we use?
